## Installation

To install all the necessary dependencies for the project, run:

```bash
npm install
```

from the root folder only. This will install the deps for both the `api` and the `client`.

### Running the client and server simultaneously

To run the server and client at the same time, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm start
```

The client will then be available on `http://localhost:3000` and the api on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Running the backend API

To run the server, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run server
```

The API will then be available on port 4000.

### Running the client

To run the client, execute the following command from the `client` folder:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The React client will then be available on port 3000.

## Testing

To test the API, navigate into the `api` folder and run:

```bash
npm run test
```
